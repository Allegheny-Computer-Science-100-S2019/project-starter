# cs100s2019-project-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for the project assignment in Computer Science 100.

Travis and GatorGrader software tools are only used for ensuring that the writing documents satisfy the minimum length requirements.

## Introduction

This assignment requires programmers to implement and test an application of your choice.
The basic requirements are:

* Use at least three classes (three java programs) that interact with each other,
	that is your class(es) call methods in other class(es).
* Have at least six methods in addition to the main method (that is,
	your classes combined should have at least six methods).
* Use one or more conditional logic statements, in the form of  if and/or switch statement(s).
* Use one or more iteration constructs, expressed as while, do-while, and for loops.
* Use  ArrayList and/or array(s) data structures.

Gradle must used to compile and run the `Main.java` program that contains the `main` method and connects to other classes.
Your implementation should be verified by
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle) and the source programs
must adhere to all of the requirements in the [Google
Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

The programmers are also responsible for submitting all of the required writing
material in the appropriate files inside `writing` directory. These are
Markdown files that must adhere to the standards
described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name of
the file in your GitHub repository.

A carefully formatted assignment sheet for the final project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the course web site.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the laboratory
session or office hours. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team
for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course
instructor's office hours.
